# File Permissions in Linux

## Project Description

As a Security Analyst at a Technology organization, I’m tasked with updating file permissions for some files and directories within the projects directory. The permissions do not currently reflect the level of authorization that should be given. Checking and updating these permissions will help keep the organization’s system secure. I performed the following tasks to ensure these needs were met:

1. Check file and directory details
2. Describe the permissions string
3. Change file permissions
4. Change file permissions on a hidden file
5. Change directory permissions
